            <p>
                We, the CDC, have embarked on a mission to help communities around the Rochester area struggling with 
                food insecurities. In America, according to the RTS*, an approximate 130 billion meals are wasted each 
                year. Instead of feeding the landfills, these meals could go to people in need. Our purpose is to source 
                crowdfunding and provide substantial and equitable food necessities to all in need. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our targets are food businesses that throw away foods in good condition. We will form relationships with 
                businesses who are willing to donate these foods. We will hire people to drive food trucks around Rochester 
                picking up those unused foods and catering them to the public. Our goal is to decrease hunger while 
                simultaneously decreasing unnecessary food waste.
